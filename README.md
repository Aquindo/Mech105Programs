# Mech105Programs
## A repository storing all of my mech 105 MATLAB programs created throughout the semester
As I have progressed through MECH 105, I have written several MATLAB functions and callers to use with numerical analysis. I have uploaded those here to be used by anyone, and to document my work.
## The Programs are as follow:
* Matrices
* Root Finding
* LU Factorization
* Simpson's 1/3
* Linear Regression
