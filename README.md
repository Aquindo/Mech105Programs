# Mech105Programs
## A repository storing all of my mech 105 MATLAB programs created throughout the semester
As I have progressed through MECH 105, I have written several MATLAB functions and callers to use with numerical analysis. I have uploaded those here to be used by anyone, and to document my work.
## The Programs are as follow:
* Matrices: Function to create a matrix with a special pattern
* Root Finding: Functions to find roots in different methods
* LU Factorization: Function to sort through a system of equations
* Simpson's 1/3: Function to find the area under a function
* Linear Regression: Function to create a line of best fit
