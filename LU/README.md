# LU Decomposition
## What is it?
These matrix programs will take a system of equations in matrix form and perfrom LU Decomposition on it to break it apart into a pivot matrix, upper matrix, and a lower matrix.
### Inputs
* coef - A square matrix containing the system of equations
### Outputs
* L - A lower triangular matrix which contains the multipliers used for elimination in the decomposition process
* U - A upper traingular matrix which contains the variables for each value after elimination
* P - A matrix which is used to keep track of any pivoting done in the process
