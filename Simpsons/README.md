# Simpsons 1/3 Rule
## What is it
Simpson's 1/3 rule is a method of connecting data points together to compute an estimate of the area under the function similar to integration.
## What does the function do
The function will take in an array of x and y values, and will use those to compute a estimate of the area of the function
### Inputs
* x - an array of equally spaced X values
* y - an array of y values corresponding to x. Must be same length
### Outputs
* I - A value indicating the estimate for the area under the curve.
