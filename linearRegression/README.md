# Linear Regression
## What is it
The linear regression program takes an array of x and y values and creates a line of best fit. It will calculate how much each data value correlates with each other as well, meaning you can find if the data has a function.
### Inputs
* X - an array of x values
* Y - an array of y values
### Outputs
* fX - the array of x values in ascending order
* fY - the array of y values in ascending order
* slope - the slope of the equation for line of best fit
* intercept - the y intercept of the equation for the line of best fit
* Rsquared - how closely all the data points are related to the line of best fit (R <= .8 is good!)
